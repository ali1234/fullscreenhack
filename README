Fullscreen hack for Flash Plugin
Author: Alistair Buxton <a.j.buxton@gmail.com>


Why
---

Flash plugin incorrectly determines the fullscreen resolution when using nvidia twinview. 
The result is that fullscreen windows fill the primary monitor, but the video gets scaled as if
the primary monitor had the resolution of the total display area.

How
---

The npviewer script loads the hack with LD_PRELOAD and it patches the XGetGeometry call
which flash uses to determine screen size. If XGetGeometry would return the size of the root
window, the patch causes it to instead return the size of the primary monitor.

*** NOTE: you must enter the sizes of your root window and primary monitor before compiling ***
          (i will fix this later)

Config
------

Edit fullscreenhack.c and change the #defines.

Dependencies
------------

You need 32 bit toolchain if you use 32 bit flash in nspluginwrapper.
sudo apt-get build-dep nspluginwrapper should give you everything you need.

For native plugins you should just need build-essential and libx11-dev.

For 32-bit Flash in ndiswrapper:
--------------------------------

Build it:

make 

Test it:

make test

This runs the tester app with and without the patch to verify that it works.

Install it:

sudo make install

And then restart your browser.

For native Flash plugin:
------------------------

Build it:

If your OS is 64-bit, edit Makefile and change it to BITS=64 on line 1.

Run make and make test as above.

To use it, you have to run your browser as such:

LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libfullscreenhack.so firefox
